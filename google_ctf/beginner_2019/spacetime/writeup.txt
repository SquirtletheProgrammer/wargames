# Methodology:
* Easiest way was to do strings rand2
# Another method was to understand the code

* there is one called next_destination
* write the C code for the function and return the values
* learned the second method from https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2019_GoogleCTF_BQ/Enter_Space_Time_Coordinates.md
