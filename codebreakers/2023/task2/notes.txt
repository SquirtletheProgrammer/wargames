Where are the other 20 pins from? jtag?
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101416/0100/Hardware-Description/Target-Interfaces/ARM-Standard-JTAG
The jtag also has 20 pins, but most of them are ground whereas the ones in the diagram look like they are gpio
Could be something like this? https://sysprogs.com/VisualKernel/tutorials/raspberry/jtagsetup/

This looks similar; gpio extender? 
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/two.html
So maybe it's some follower device, with the leader as the raspberry pi
I think the extra 20 pins are from an i/o expander


Tried: 
power: P2, P4
ground: P6
uart txd: P8
uart rxd: P10


Alt5 might be a hint to something
https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/computers/hardware/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-gpio-pin-alternate-functions-143761/
It indicates that gpio is now 20 and 21?
https://cs140e.sergio.bz/docs/BCM2837-ARM-Peripherals.pdf
The data sheet shows that there are different places for different boot modes
We have boot mode alt5 under alternative function assignment
According to the documentation, GPIO40 -> TXD1, GPIO41 -> RXD1
There are other options for alt5, but those pins are blanked out in the diagram. These options include GPIO32 -> TXD1, GPIO33 -> RXD1, 
GPIO14 -> TXD1, GPIO15 -> RXD1
TX (transmit) -> GPIO40 -> P31
RX (receive) -> GPIO41 -> P33

The tx/rx is correct, but the power is wrong.
The voltage should be on the same line as the gpio pins, so it should be P29
The ground should be on a different wire I think so P30
Yes solution is
P29, P30, P31, P33
