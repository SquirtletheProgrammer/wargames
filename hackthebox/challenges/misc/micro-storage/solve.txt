Observe that "-" and "." are allowed and we can tar something
The tar command iterates through the files in the directory and so by naming a file with the "-" symbol, we can add arguments to the tar command
At first, I tried using the directory=.. command as a filename but I think the parent directory did not contain the flag
I then found the flag --files-from 
With this flag, I could put more flags into a file
