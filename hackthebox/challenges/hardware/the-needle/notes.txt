# TODO:

Create a docker image and install firmadyne on it, and then extract the root file system onto that local machine

Can use binwalk to extract the firmware.bin file 

However, I was unable to get sasquatch running

grep login to find username, and then grep sign to get password


Important to note that in the extraction process, all of the files are not in the correct directory and everything basically got flattened
