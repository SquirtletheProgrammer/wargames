Steps are to open the .sal file in Logic2. It uses universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter protocol which sends information in 8 bit frames (usually). We see that bits are transferred in intervals of 32.04 microseconds, so every second, 1 / (3.2 * 10^-5) bits are transferred, which is equal to 31250 bits / second.
