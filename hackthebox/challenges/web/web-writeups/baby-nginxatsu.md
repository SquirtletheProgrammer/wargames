I saw from the config file generated that there was an extension called /storage. I visited the extension and saw that there was an sqlite3 database. I used the terminal command sqlite3 to open the database. I then saw that there was a table of users. I got the email and passord hashes, cracked the hash for jr and logged in as jr. This gave me the flag.

The flag is HTB{ng1ngx_r34lly_b3_sp1ll1ng_my_w3ll_h1dd3n_s3cr3ts??}.

Note: This had really cool css.
