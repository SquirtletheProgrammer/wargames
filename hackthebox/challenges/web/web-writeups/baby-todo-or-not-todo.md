I inspected the page and saw that there was a warning against calling the function getstatus('all'). I ran the code getTasks('all') in the console, and was able to find the flag. The flag disappears pretty quickly, but you can send the request to Repeater on BurpSuite to get persistence. 
Flag is HTB{l3ss_ch0r3s_m0r3_h4ck1ng...right?!!1}
