XSS problem

- Need to create a webhook endpoint
- Need to get the admin to send the token somewhere
- Bot is responsible for submitting something to an endpoint
- The CDN that is listed as a valid source for scripts allows github so we can upload a script to github, and then load the script from github
- The script executes and then it can send the token to the webhook endpoint
-
