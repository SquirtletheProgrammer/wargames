Not sure what I should be looking for in this image

52f file seems to be the layer for establishing the directory structure 
According to the other two layers, there seems to be something inside of the /usr/share folder
I think the usr/share/lib/.wh..wh..opq indicates that /usr/lib was replaced meaning recovering it might be the way to get the flag
Use the command tar -tf on the files
